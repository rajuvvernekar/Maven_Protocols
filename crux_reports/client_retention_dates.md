## Protocol


# CLIENT RETENTION DATES PROTOCOL

## Section A: Reference Data

### A1 — Settlement Fundamentals

- Settlement happens separately for each segment: equity and F&O (under Zerodha), commodity (under Zerodha Commodities). Amounts and dates may differ per segment.
- If a client has positions across segments, check for entries under both Zerodha and Zerodha Commodities.
- Total QS payout = sum of releases across all segments.
- QS payouts are typically credited to the client's registered bank account within 1–2 working days of the settlement date.
- For QS schedule, opt-out rules, and LIQUIDCASE interaction → invoke `ledger_report`.

### A2 — Retention Reasons

| Retention Type | Field | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| Margin retained | `margin` | Funds held for open F&O or commodity positions requiring margin |
| Pending obligation | `obligation` | Net amount due from or to the client for recent trades still in the settlement cycle (e.g., shares bought on the trading day before settlement — payment obligation pending until T+1) |
| Maximum retention amount | `max_retention_amount` | Total the broker can retain per SEBI regulations to cover open positions and pending obligations |

---

| `eq_margin` | Equity margin component |
| `turnover` | Total trade turnover for the settlement period |

## Section B: Decision Flow

### Routing
```
Query relates to QS payout / client retention →
│
├─ Client asks how much was paid out and why
│  → Rule 1
│
├─ Client expected full balance but received less
│  → Rule 2
│
├─ Zero payout (funds_released = 0)
│  → Rule 3
│
├─ QS funds not received in bank
│  → Rule 4
│
├─ Client asks what "obligation" means
│  → Rule 6
│
└─ Data mismatch / no root cause found
   → Rule 7 (Escalation)

Note: If client has positions across multiple segments, apply Rule 5
in combination with any of the above routes.
```

### Fallback

If no root cause is identified after checking all relevant rules → Escalate.

## Section C: Rules

### Rule 1 — QS Payout Breakdown

Use values from the report — `funds_released`, `margin`, `obligation`, and `max_retention_amount` (per A2 definitions). The `max_retention_amount` is what the broker can retain per SEBI regulations. The remaining balance is released to the client's registered bank account. Invoke `ledger_report` for the corresponding payout ledger entry.

---

### Rule 2 — Partial QS Payout

Not all funds are released during QS. Funds are retained for open F&O or commodity positions requiring margin (`margin`), pending trade obligations from recent settlements (`obligation`), and collateral adjustments. The actual payout is `funds_released`; the retained amount is `max_retention_amount`.

---

### Rule 3 — Zero Payout

`funds_released` = 0 for the settlement date. The entire balance was retained because margin required for open positions and pending obligations equal or exceed the available balance. Once positions are closed or obligations settled, funds become available.

---

### Rule 4 — QS Payout Not Received in Bank

`funds_released` > 0 but the client has not received the payout in their bank account. Invoke `get_all_client_data` and check `bank account` to confirm the registered bank account details. Credit timing is 1–2 working days per A1. If more than 3 working days have passed and the amount has not been credited → escalate.

---

### Rule 5 — Multiple Segment Settlements

Invoke `get_all_client_data` and check `segments` to confirm which segments the client is enabled for. Client has positions across equity/F&O and commodity segments, resulting in entries under both Zerodha and Zerodha Commodities. Present the settlement breakdown for each segment separately. Total QS payout is the sum of `funds_released` across both segments.

---

### Rule 6 — Obligation Explanation

Apply A2.

---

### Rule 7 — Escalation

Any trigger in A4 is met, or no root cause identified after checking all relevant rules. Escalate. Include: client ID, settlement_date, funds_released, max_retention_amount, and the specific issue. client retension statement
