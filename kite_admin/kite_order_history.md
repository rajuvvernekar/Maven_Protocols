# kite_order_history

## Description

WHEN TO USE:

When clients:
- Ask about orders placed on a past date or date range (not today's live orders)
- Ask about order rejection reason from a previous day
- Ask about execution details for historical orders (average price, filled quantity, exchange timestamp)
- Ask about a specific instrument's order history (e.g., "what happened with my INFY order last week?")
- Ask whether an order was placed by them or auto-squared off by RMS (ADMINSQF/rms)
- Ask about auto square-off history (when it happened, why, at what price, and the charge)
- Report auto square-off failure (MIS position carried forward as CNC/NRML)
- Ask about SIP order execution or failures from past dates (wrong product type, insufficient margin)
- Ask about ATO (Alert Trigger Order) execution history and rejections (freeze quantity limit)
- Ask about GTT-triggered order results (whether the triggered order was executed or rejected)
- Ask about basket order execution history (which orders succeeded or failed)
- Ask about AMO (After Market Order) execution from past dates (conversion to limit, pre-open behavior)
- Ask about iceberg order execution (parent-child order relationship)
- Want to verify order details from a past trading session (price, quantity, time, status)
- Dispute an order or trade from a previous day
- Ask whether a trade was intraday or delivery (using product type and buy/sell pairing)
- Ask about F&O buy average calculation (FIFO method across product types)
- Ask why equity buy average unchanged after same-day sell and rebuy (intraday treatment, except T2T)

## Protocol

# KITE ORDER HISTORY PROTOCOL

## Section A: Reference Data

### A1 — Fundamentals

- For today's live orders, invoke `kite_orders`.  
- Orders follow price-time priority: first come, first served at same price.  
- Zerodha pre-validates orders — some rejections won't appear in order book (shown in status notification only).  
- Execution time beyond market hours = exchange reconciliation after connectivity issues, not actual execution beyond hours.

### A8 — `placed_by` Values

| Value | Meaning |  
|---|---|  
| Client ID (6-char) | Normal client-placed order |  
| ADMINSQF | Auto square-off by Zerodha RMS |  
| Starts with "rms" \+ number | Squared off by Zerodha RMS |

### A9 — Common Rejections

| Rejection | Meaning | Resolution |  
|---|---|---|  
| Insufficient margin | Not enough margin | Invoke `kite_margins`. Add funds. Can still exit. |  
| Negative cash | MTM losses | Add cash. Can still exit existing positions. |  
| Max order value | Exceeds ₹10 Crore | Split, use iceberg or basket. |  
| Max quantity | Exceeds 1,00,000 | Reduce qty, use iceberg or basket. |  
| Trigger price invalid | SL buy: trigger ≤ limit. SL sell: trigger ≥ limit. | Correct and retry. |  
| SL trigger-limit gap | Exceeds exchange range | Narrow the gap. |  
| LPP range | Price outside protection range | Retry closer to market price. |  
| Theoretical price | Option too far from theoretical | Place closer to theoretical. |  
| Ban period | F&O in ban | Exit only, no new positions/intraday. |  
| Exchange restricted | Account restricted | New account (3 days), KRA pending, NRI status. |  
| SL-M on BSE | Discontinued | Use SL-L instead. |  
| OI restriction | Broker OI cap (NRML blocked) | MIS allowed. Consider Orbis custodial. |  
| Currency position limit | Client limit exceeded | USDINR 85K, EURINR/GBPINR 5K, JPYINR 2K. |  
| MTF sell conflict | Open CNC/MTF sell for same stock | Buy via CNC instead. |  
| Market order blocked | Stock options, T2T, debt, illiquid/deep ITM, zero-volume | Use limit order. |  
| MIS blocked | T2T, ASM/GSM, low-liquidity, high-VAR, ban period | Use CNC or NRML. |

### A10 — AMO Rules

| Rule | Detail |  
|---|---|  
| NSE/BSE equity window | 4:00 PM – 8:58 AM |  
| F&O window | 3:45 PM – 9:10 AM |  
| MCX window | 5:00 PM – 9:10 AM |  
| AMO market for index options | Blocked — use limit |  
| Pre-open AMO market | Converts to limit at equilibrium/previous close |  
| Sell AMO without DDPI/POA | T-day stocks: only after 6:30 AM next day. Delivered stocks: after 5 PM. |

### A11 — Special Order Types

| Field | Value | Meaning |  
|---|---|---|  
| `sip` | "Yes" | SIP order — must use Regular CNC \+ market/limit |  
| `ato` | "Yes" | ATO (alert-triggered) — order slicing not supported, qty within freeze limit |  
| `basket` | basket name | Part of a basket — each order validated independently |  
| `gtt` | trigger ID | GTT trigger ID — order was placed by a GTT trigger |  
| `variety` = "iceberg" | — | Iceberg — `parent_order_id` links child orders to parent |

### A12 — Intraday Identification Logic

| Pattern | Classification |  
|---|---|  
| MIS or CO product | Intraday trade |  
| CNC with only BUY (no same-day SELL) | Delivery / long-term |  
| CNC with BUY \+ SELL same instrument same qty same day | Intraday round-trip (speculative, not delivery) |  
| NRML | Overnight F&O position |  
| MTF | Margin Trading Facility (delivery with leverage) |  
| BUY (MIS) \+ SELL by ADMINSQF/rms | Intraday auto squared off |

- Exception: T2T stocks — same-day buy+sell treated as delivery, buy average updates to latest buy price.  
- F&O buy average: FIFO across product types (MIS \+ NRML combined). Earliest buy matches first sell.  
- Equity CNC sell \+ rebuy same day: Original buy average unchanged. Same-day round-trip = speculative per income tax rules.

### A14 — Escalation Data

Include when escalating to human agent: client ID, instrument, date, order details, and specific issue.

## Section B: Decision Flow

### Routing

```  
Route by scenario  
   ├─ Order status check (any) → Rule 1  
   ├─ Order complete — execution / price questions → Rule 2  
   ├─ Order rejected → Rule 3  
   ├─ placed_by = ADMINSQF or "rms" prefix → Rule 4  
   ├─ Order open in history (unusual) → Rule 5  
   ├─ Order cancelled → Rule 6  
   ├─ "I didn't place this order" → Rule 7  
   ├─ SIP order investigation → Rule 8  
   ├─ ATO order investigation → Rule 9  
   ├─ AMO order behavior → Rule 10  
   ├─ Basket order investigation → Rule 11  
   ├─ Execution time beyond market hours → Rule 12  
   ├─ F&O buy average / intraday identification → Rule 13  
   ├─ Multiple orders for same instrument → Rule 14  
   ├─ No matching orders found → Rule 15  
   └─ app_id is numerical (third-party API) and rejection/rate limit query → Rule 16  
```

### Fallback

If no root cause found after completing all diagnostic steps → escalate to human agent per **A14**.

## Section C: Rules

### Rule 1 — Order Status Check

1. Locate by instrument \+ date.  
2. Share: `instrument`, `type`, `order_type`, `order_status`, `total_quantity`, `filled_quantity`, `average_price` (if COMPLETE), `exchange_timestamp`.  
3. Check `placed_by` internally → ADMINSQF/rms → Rule 4.  
4. Check `gtt` internally → GTT ID present → invoke `kite_gtt` or `kite_gtt_archived` scoped to the trigger date.  
5. Check `app_id` internally → numerical value → if rejection or rate limit query, route to Rule 16.  
6. Route by status: COMPLETE → Rule 2, REJECTED → Rule 3, OPEN → Rule 5, CANCELLED → Rule 6.

### Rule 2 — Order Complete

1. Confirm: `type` order for `total_quantity` of `instrument` was executed at `average_price` on `exchange_timestamp`.  
2. Price discrepancy:  
   a. Market order → market orders fill at the best available price.  
   b. Limit at better price → limit orders guarantee the price as the worst, not the exact price.  
   c. Client wanted breakout → use SL or GTT instead. Invoke `kite_gtt` if interested.  
   d. SL trigger dispute → charts show snapshots; actual market price determines execution.  
3. Partial fill → check `filled_quantity` < `total_quantity`; share `cancelled_quantity`.  
4. Where are bought shares? → invoke `kite_holdings` (settled) or `kite_positions` (same day / F&O).

### Rule 3 — Order Rejected

1. Read `rejection_reason`, match against **A9**.  
2. For margin rejections → invoke `kite_margins`.  
3. For ban period → if client asks about current position → invoke `kite_positions`.  
4. If `app_id` is numerical and rejection relates to market protection, rate limit, or IOC on MCX → route to Rule 16.  
5. For unmatched rejection → share `rejection_reason` verbatim.

### Rule 4 — RMS / Admin Square-Off

1. `placed_by` = ADMINSQF or starts with "rms" per **A8**.  
2. Invoke `kite_margins` to check margin shortfall.  
3. Check if MIS \+ near auto square-off time per **A6**.  
4. Check for negative cash balance.  
5. Order was executed by Zerodha's risk management system on `exchange_timestamp`. Typical reasons: insufficient margin to maintain position; intraday (MIS) auto squared off at scheduled time per **A6**; negative cash balance requiring closure.  
6. If MIS carried forward after square-off failure → failure can occur due to circuit limits, system failures, or connectivity. MIS converts to CNC/NRML per **A6** — client must close next trading day.

### Rule 5 — Order Open in History

1. Unusual in history — likely later cancelled at session end.  
2. Check for corresponding CANCELLED entry for same instrument/date. If found → Rule 6.  
3. If genuinely open → auto-cancelled at session end per **A7**.

### Rule 6 — Order Cancelled

1. Cancelled near session end → auto-cancelled at session end per **A7**. Suggest re-placing next session, or use GTT for orders valid up to 1 year. Invoke `kite_gtt` if client wants persistent order.  
2. LPP/price range → exchange cancelled order — price was outside the allowed range. Retry closer to market price.  
3. Partial fill \+ cancelled remainder → partially filled, share `filled_quantity` of `total_quantity` at `average_price`. Remaining `cancelled_quantity` was cancelled.  
4. IOC → IOC orders auto-cancel any unfilled portion immediately.

### Rule 7 — Unauthorized ("I Didn't Place This")

1. Check `placed_by`:  
   a. ADMINSQF/rms → apply Rule 4.  
   b. Client's own ID → order appears placed from client's account. Escalate to human agent per **A14** for investigation. Suggest checking third-party Kite Connect API access; consider blocking account if unauthorized.

### Rule 8 — SIP Order Investigation

1. `sip` = "Yes" or client asks about SIP failure.  
2. If REJECTED → share reason. Common: wrong product (must be Regular CNC), insufficient margin, instrument blocked, qty exceeded.  
3. If COMPLETE → share execution details per Rule 2.  
4. If no order found → SIP may not have triggered. Verify: basket linked to SIP, product type Regular CNC, order type market or limit. Check registered email — Zerodha sends a SIP summary email with rejection reasons.

### Rule 9 — ATO Order Investigation

1. `ato` = "Yes" or client asks about ATO.  
2. If REJECTED → share reason. ATO orders place automatically when Kite alert triggers. Order slicing not supported — quantity must be within exchange freeze limit.

### Rule 10 — AMO Order Behavior

1. AMO market for index options → blocked per **A10**, use limit.  
2. Pre-open AMO market → converts to limit at equilibrium/previous close per **A10**.  
3. Sell AMO without DDPI/POA → per **A10**: T-day stocks after 6:30 AM next day; delivered after 5 PM.

### Rule 11 — Basket Order Investigation

1. `basket` field has a value → order was part of a basket. Basket orders execute individually — each subject to its own margin and exchange validation. Some may succeed while others fail.

### Rule 12 — Execution Time Beyond Market Hours

1. Displayed time reflects exchange reconciliation after a connectivity disruption per **A1**. Order was executed within market hours. Direct client to tradebook for actual execution time.

### Rule 13 — F&O Buy Average / Intraday Identification

1. F&O buy average: FIFO across MIS \+ NRML combined per **A12**.  
2. Equity CNC sell \+ rebuy same day: per **A12**.  
3. Identifying intraday: use patterns from **A12**.  
4. MIS sell instead of CNC: if client sold under MIS while holding CNC shares → MIS sell created a fresh short intraday position, not a delivery exit. CNC holdings remain. MIS auto-squared off per **A6**. To sell delivery holdings, use CNC.  
5. If client asks about current buy average → invoke `kite_holdings`. Current positions → invoke `kite_positions`.

### Rule 14 — Multiple Orders for Same Instrument

1. Summarize count and list each with `type`, `order_type`, `product`, `order_status`, `quantity`, `price`.  
2. Use **A12** to identify trade type from product and buy/sell pairing.

### Rule 15 — No Matching Orders Found

1. No orders found for instrument between `from_date` and `to_date`. Direct client to verify instrument name, exchange, and date range. Orders rejected pre-exchange may not appear in history.

### Rule 16 — API Order Issues (SEBI Retail Algo Rules)

1. Rate limit (429 response): API application exceeded the 10 orders-per-second rate limit. Per SEBI retail algo regulations. To place more than 10 orders per second, the trading strategy must be registered with the stock exchange. Link per **A13**.  
2. Market protection rejection: market and SL-M orders placed via API with market protection set to 0 are rejected. Mandated by exchanges for all algo orders. Use limit order or set an appropriate market protection value. Link per **A13**.  
3. MCX IOC rejection: MCX does not support IOC validity in the algo segment. Orders via third-party API on MCX with IOC validity will be rejected. Use DAY validity instead.  
4. Order slicing: API order slicing should be capped at a maximum of 10 slices to stay within the 10 orders-per-second rate limit.  
5. For details on all SEBI retail algo compliance, share link from **A13**.
