## Protocol


# MF FUND ALLOCATION REPORT PROTOCOL

## Section A: Reference Data

### A1 — Scope

- Shows payments reported to BSE STAR MF and their mapping to orders.
- One UTR can map to multiple orders (bulk payment).

---

### A2 — NEFT/RTGS/IMPS Exclusion

NEFT/RTGS/IMPS payments go directly to ICCL and do not appear in this report — for these queries, invoke `mf_order_history`.

---

### A3 — Redemption (SELL) Exclusion

This report covers BUY-side payments only — redemption proceeds are credited directly to the client's bank account and are not tracked here. For redemption/sell order details, invoke `mf_order_history`.

---

### A4 — Settlement & Allotment Flag Meanings

| `settled_flag` | `allotment_flag` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Y | Y | Payment settled, units allotted. |
| Y | N | Payment settled, allotment pending from the AMC. |
| N | — (within T+1 of payment) | Payment received; exchange settlement in progress. Allotment pending — allow one working day. |
| N | — (beyond T+2) | Payment received but exchange settlement not completed. Order will not process; refund per A5. |

---

### A5 — Refund Status

Standard refund language: "The debited amount will be refunded by BSE STAR MF to your source bank account within 5–7 working days (excluding weekends and holidays)."

| Condition | Communicate |
|---|---|
| `refund_utr` populated | Refund processed. Share `refund_amount`, `date_of_refund` (only if present in the report), and `refund_utr`. Direct client to track with their bank using `refund_utr`. |
| `refund_utr` empty | Apply standard refund language. |

---

### A6 — Field Rules

**Shareable with client:**

| Field | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| `order_number` | Order number for the application |
| `utr_no` | Unique Transaction Reference number for the payment |
| `payment_date` | Date the payment was made |
| `total_allocated_amount` | Total amount allocated |
| `total_settlement_amount` | Total amount settled with the exchange |
| `total_allotment_amount` | Total amount allotted |
| `refund_amount` | Refund amount — share only if present |
| `date_of_refund` | Date the refund was processed — share only if present |
| `refund_utr` | UTR number for the refund — share only if present |

**Non-shareable:**

| Field | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| `settled_flag` | Y = payment settled with exchange; N = not settled |
| `allotment_flag` | Y = units allotted; N = allotment not yet done |
| `settlement_number` | Maps to `settlement_id` in `mf_order_history` for cross-referencing |
| `remitter_acct_no` | Client's bank account used for payment |
| `error_remarks` | Rejection reason — check for "INVALID BANK ACCOUNT DETAIL" |
| `cfppg_bank_ref_no` | Maps to `cashier_reference` in `mandate_debit_report` for mandate payment cross-referencing |

## Section B: Decision Flow

### Routing

```
Query relates to MF payment / fund allocation →
│
├─ Payment debited but order not allotted / units not showing → Rule 1
└─ Refund status or refund UTR query → Rule 2
```

### Fallback

If no root cause is identified → escalate.

## Section C: Rules

### Rule 1 — Payment & Allotment Status

Find the row by payment date or UTR. Invoke `mf_order_history` using `order_number` = `exchange_order_id` and `settlement_number` = `settlement_id` to cross-reference the order.

If `error_remarks` contains "INVALID BANK ACCOUNT DETAIL" → escalate.

If both `order_number` AND `settlement_number` are null or empty → unmapped payment. Apply A5 refund language.

Check `settled_flag` and `allotment_flag` per A4:

- `settled_flag` = N → invoke `settlement_date_calculator` with `payment_date` to compute T+1 and T+2 working days:
  - Within T+1 → communicate: payment pending settlement. Allow one working day.
  - Beyond T+2 → order will not process. Apply A5 refund status logic.
- `settled_flag` = Y, `allotment_flag` = N → communicate: payment settled, allotment pending from the AMC.
- `settled_flag` = Y, `allotment_flag` = Y → check order status in `mf_order_history`. If status shows Processing → invoke `settlement_date_calculator` with `exchange_timestamp` to compute T+3 working days:
  - Within T+3 → late delivery of units. Communicate that payment is settled, units are allotted, and holdings will be credited.
  - Beyond T+3 → escalate.

---

### Rule 2 — Refund Status

Find the row by payment date or UTR. Check `refund_utr` per A5:

- `refund_utr` populated → share `refund_amount`, `date_of_refund` (only if present in the report), and `refund_utr`. Direct client to track with their bank.
- `refund_utr` empty → apply A5 refund language.
